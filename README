Pre-reqs/Dependencies
---------------------

Alloy
--
You need Alloy 1.3.1 to build this project, get it by doing the following
sudo npm -g remove alloy
and then
sudo npm install -g alloy@1.3.1

Titanium
--
You'll also need a custom version of the Titanium SDK to add a 'scroll event' in the listview. As soon as Titanium adds a 'scroll' event to the lists, this is not a dependancy. 
3.3.0-Custom - Can be downloaded from http://dogfishdata.com/custom-sdks/3.3.0.Custom.zip
